# PI-to-MATLAB-Utility

The PI to MATLAB utility is a small utility that was developed by an OSIsoft Academic Program intern. The utility automatically runs a MATLAB Instance and allows the user to inject PI System Data into this MATLAB Instance, as variable(s). Currently it connects to the default AF Server and the first AF database.

This repository contains the source files to build this utility as well as the Windows Installer to install it on your computer.

**The content in this repository is explained in the [White Paper - Using the PI-to-MATLAB Utility][2] available on PI Square**. Make sure to have a look into it!

## Installation and Removal

**Installation**

- Download the file Setup.zip: **[PI to Matlab Utility Setup Kit - Latest][3]**
- Run setup.exe from the extracted setup folder. After the installation you should then see an entry PI-to-MATLAB Utility in your start menu.

**Uninstall**

To uninstall, go to add or remove programs in windows, and uninstall PI-to-MATLAB Utility.


## Prerequisites

You must have the following applications installed before you can run or compile the PI-to-MATLAB utility:
+ MATLAB (the versions we tested are R20014b:8.4.0.150421 and 2016a:9.0.0.341360) 
+ PI AF Software Development Kit (PI AF SDK) <sup>1</sup>

 
<sup>1</sup> PI AF SDK must be installed on the machine where the PI-to-MATLAB utility is used. The easiest way to obtain PI AF SDK is to download and install the **[PI Asset Framework (PI AF) Client XXX Install Kit][4]. You may obtain the PI Asset Framework Client installation kit from our Tech Support website at https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/PI-Server/PI-AF/  


## How to create the installation package
In visual studio, double click on the project properties. Then Select the Publish menu.  Click on Publish Now.
This will create a new click-once application called setup.exe under the Setup folder of the repository.

If you want to uninstall the application, use the add-remove program Windows feature.
